üêÄ lil gopher daemon

point it at a directory and it'll serve up all its text files, sub-directories, and binary files over gopher.

special files:

- **header.gph**: if it exists in a directory, its content will be shown above the directory's content. put ascii art in it.
- **footer.gph**: same, but will be shown below a directory's content.
- **index.gph**: completely replaces a directory's content with what's in this file.
- **??.gph**: visiting gopher://yoursite/1/dog/ will try to render `dog.gph` from disk.
- **.reverse**: if this exists, the directory contents will be listed in reverse alphanumeric order. useful for phloggin'.

Any line in a `.gph` file that doesn't contain tabs (`\t`) and doesn't start with an `i` will get an `i` automatically prefixed, turning it into a gopher information item. 

Any `.gph` file that is marked **executable** with be run as if it were a shell script and its output will be sent to the client. It will be passed three arguments: the query string (if any, the host, and the port. Do with them what you will. (CGI-BIN is back, baby.)

For example:

    $ cat echo.gph
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hi, world! You said:" $1

Then:

    $ gopher-client gopher://localhost/1/echo?something
    Hi, world! You said: something

    phd -p 7070 docs             # Serve 'docs' directory on port 7070
    phd -h localhost             # Serve cwd using hostname "localhost".
