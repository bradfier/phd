.SH NAME
.P
phd - an estoeric gopher server
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBphd\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fISITE ROOT\fR]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBphd\fR is a small, easy-to-use gopher server.
.P
Point it at a directory and it'll serve up all the text files,
sub-directories, and binary files over Gopher. Any \fB.gph\fR files will
be served up as Gophermaps and executable \fB.gph\fR files will be
run as a program with their output served to the client, like the
glorious cgi-bin days of yore!
.P
Usually \fBphd\fR is started with a path to your Gopher site:
.P
.RS 4
phd /srv/gopher
.P
.RE
If no path is given, \fBphd\fR will use the current directory as the root
of your Gopher site.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB-r\fR \fISELECTOR\fR, \fB--render\fR \fISELECTOR\fR
.P
.RS 4
Rather than start as a server, render the \fISELECTOR\fR of the site using the options provided and print the raw response to \fBSTDOUT\fR.
.P
.RE
\fB-b\fR \fIADDRESS\fR, \fB--bind\fR \fIADDRESS\fR
.RS 4
Set the socket address to bind to, e.g. \fB127.0.0.1:7070\fR
.P
.RE
\fB-p\fR \fIPORT\fR, \fB--port\fR \fIPORT\fR
.RS 4
Set the \fIPORT\fR to use when generating Gopher links.
.P
.RE
\fB-h\fR \fIHOST\fR, \fB--host\fR \fIHOST\fR
.RS 4
Set the \fIHOST\fR to use when generating Gopher links.
.P
.RE
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
.RS 4
Print a help summary and exit.
.P
.RE
\fB-v\fR, \fB--version\fR
.RS 4
Print version information and exit.
.P
.RE
.SH SPECIAL FILES
.P
The following files have special behavior when present in a directory
that \fBphd\fR is tasked with serving:
.P
\fBheader.gph\fR
.RS 4
If it exists in a directory, its content will be shown above the directory's content. Put ASCII art in it.
.P
.RE
\fBfooter.gph\fR
.RS 4
Same, but will be shown below a directory's content.
.P
.RE
\fBindex.gph\fR
.RS 4
Completely replaces a directory's content with what's in this file.
.P
.RE
\fB??.gph\fR
.RS 4
Visiting \fBgopher://yoursite/1/dog/\fR will try to render \fBdog.gph\fR from disk. Visiting \fB/1/dog.gph\fR will render the raw content of the .gph file.
.P
.RE
\fB.reverse\fR
.RS 4
If this exists, the directory contents will be listed in reverse alphanumeric order. Useful for phloggin', if you date your posts.
.P
.RE
.SH GOPHERMAP SYNTAX
.P
Any line in a \fB.gph\fR file that doesn't contain tabs (\fBt\fR) will get an
\fBi\fR automatically prefixed, turning it into a Gopher information item.
.P
For your convenience, phd supports \fBgeomyidae\fR syntax for
creating links:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
This is an info line\&.
[1|This is a link|/help|server|port]
[h|URL Link|URL:https://noogle\&.com]
.fi
.RE
.P
\fBserver\fR and \fBport\fR will get translated into the server and port of
the actively running server, eg \fBlocalhost\fR and \fB7070\fR.
.P
Any line containing a tab character (\fBt\fR) will be sent as-is to the
client, meaning you can write and serve up raw Gophermap files too.
.P
.SH DYNAMIC CONTENT
.P
Any \fB.gph\fR file that is marked \fBexecutable\fR with be run as if it
were a standalone program and its output will be sent to the client.
It will be passed three arguments: the query string (if any), the
server's hostname, and the current port. Do with them what you will.
.P
For example:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
$ cat echo\&.gph
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hi, world! You said:" $1
echo "1Visit Gopherpedia	/	gopherpedia\&.com	70"
.fi
.RE
.P
Then:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
$ gopher-client gopher://localhost/1/echo?something
[INFO] Hi, world! You said: something
[LINK] Visit Gopherpedia
.fi
.RE
.P
Or more seriously:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
$ cat figlet\&.gph
#!/bin/sh
figlet $1
.fi
.RE
.P
then:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
$ gopher-client gopher://localhost/1/figlet?hi gopher
